# FileCtor

File inspector with interactive console.

The idea is to have something similar to other file system managers, e.g. [TotalCommander](https://www.ghisler.com/). But this app is intended for Developers as it allows to run various JS scripts against files and directories.

## Installation

1. Download latest release from [here](https://github.com/tomaschyly/FileCtor/releases). Win32 is for Windows. Darwin is for MacOS.
2. For Windows, unzip anywhere you want to have the app installed. For MacOS, unzip anywhere, then copy app to your Applications folder.
3. Run the app, optionally create shortcut to use.

## Important Notes

This app is intended to be crossplatform, currently developed and tested on Windows 10 and MacOS. Ubuntu will follow.

App is using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) as it was originally ment for me to improve my skill with Electron and learn properly React.
